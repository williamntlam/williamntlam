Hi. My name is William. I'm currently a student at the University of Toronto studying computer science.
I had a old Github account that I recently deleted. Please be patient as I transfer my coding portfolio to this new Github account.

You'll notice that my portfolio mainly consists of software applications for humantarian and urban crisis problems. I am committed on making a 
positive impact on the people around me and the City of Toronto - the city that raised me.

If you would like to contact me for anything else, please feel free to do so.

Character is like a tree and reputation like a shadow. The shadow is what we think of it; the tree is the real thing
